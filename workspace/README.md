# Genesis ROM Workshop - Workspace

This is your personal workspace for ROM hacking projects.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ **projects/**
Your individual ROM modification projects. Each game gets its own subdirectory with project files, backups, and modification history.

### üìÅ **backups/**
Automatic backups of original ROM files. The workshop creates these before any modifications to ensure you can always restore the original.

### üìÅ **exports/**
Extracted assets, analysis results, and generated files. This includes sprites, palettes, audio, and documentation generated by the workshop tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Place your ROMs** in the main `roms/` directory
2. **Run the workshop**: `python grw_pipeline.py`
3. **Select your tool** and ROM file
4. **Results are saved** here in the workspace

## Project Organization Tips

### **Good Project Names:**
- `sonic_red_theme` - Clear modification description
- `phantasy_star_spanish` - Translation projects
- `streets_of_rage_rebalance` - Gameplay modifications

### **Keep Track Of:**
- Original ROM checksums for verification
- Modification history and versions
- Asset sources and relationships
- Testing notes and compatibility

## File Safety

- **Never modify original ROMs directly** - always work with copies
- **Test modifications in emulator** before considering them complete
- **Keep project documentation** for future reference
- **Use version control** for complex projects

## Workspace Commands

```bash
# Quick workspace cleanup
find workspace/ -name "*.tmp" -delete

# Project backup
tar -czf my_project_backup.tar.gz workspace/projects/sonic_red_theme/

# Asset organization
mkdir -p workspace/exports/game_name/{sprites,palettes,audio}
```
