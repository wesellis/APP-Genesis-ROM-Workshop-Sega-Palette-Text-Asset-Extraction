# Genesis ROM Workshop - Requirements
# Professional dependencies for real ROM modification tools

# Core dependencies for ROM analysis
capstone>=4.0.2        # Disassembly engine for M68K analysis (optional)

# Optional but recommended for advanced features
Pillow>=9.0.0          # Image processing for extracted graphics
numpy>=1.21.0          # Numerical processing for palette manipulation

# Development and testing (contributors only)
pytest>=7.0.0          # Unit testing framework
black>=22.0.0          # Code formatting
flake8>=4.0.0          # Code linting

# Note: This project intentionally uses minimal dependencies
# Most ROM manipulation uses Python's built-in capabilities:
# - struct: Binary data handling
# - bytes/bytearray: ROM data manipulation  
# - pathlib: File system operations
# - json: Data export and project management
# - hashlib: ROM checksums and validation
#
# We avoid heavy dependencies that add complexity without value.
# The goal is a tool that works reliably across different systems.
